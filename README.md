# Morse-Code-Converter

This repository demonstrates how to translate Morse Code by the use of Binary Tree. This program also includes sound effects and integration of files with Morse codes.

# Main task 

Write menu driven application to implement convertor which will convert Morse code to a string of characters. Consequently, the program has to perform following steps:

1)	Create Menu with 5 options (as only 5 files used)
2)	Read Morse Code from chosen file.
3)	Store gathered data in appropriate way.
4)	Use stored data and convert it from Morse Code with appropriate sounds effects.
5)	Display a result.

This is how result of program execution will look like:
